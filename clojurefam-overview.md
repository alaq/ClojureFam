# Curriculum for Learners

If you are brand-new to Clojure, we suggest that you follow the resources and material in [Onboarding for New Clojurians](https://www.notion.so/Onboarding-for-New-Clojurians-b34b38f30902448cae68afffa02425c1).

-   For new Clojurians, the goals of this program are:
    -   Completing 100 problems on 4clojure. (not necessarily in order)
    -   Working through Clojure from the Ground Up, completing exercises.
    -   Working through Brave Clojure, completing exercises.
-   For more advanced Learners: please adjust your goals to fit your current skill level.
-   The program will culminate in the Learners working together to merge at least one Pull Request addressing an Athens issue.
-   Each Learner will define their own checkpoints by submitting an issue to track their progress on the [ClojureFam Progress Board](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/projects/2).
-   Learners are encouraged to blog or Tweet about their experience learning Clojure, so as to get more people interested in the joy of Clojure programming. In fact, there is an ongoing initiative to [Learn Clojure in Public](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/blob/master/doc/learning-in-public.md).
-   Try to align yourself with the overall goals of this program:
    -   Easier onboarding for Clojure devs
    -   Easier onboarding for Athens contributors
    -   Enlightenment
-   As for Mentors: we tried to have Mentors for all Learners. This turned out to be unscalable. The number of new developers is increasing at a much higher rate than the number of senior Clojure developers. Because of this, we are currently prioritizing Learners who are contributing to the Athens source code to get any new Mentors that enter our program.

## Expectations for Learners

-   Spend at least 5 weeks in the program with your Learner partner or team.
-   Be proactive in communications. This includes in the Discord learning channel and in your team chat.
-   Set goals and expectations for yourself.
-   Aim to keep yourself and the Learners around you accountable and motivated.
-   Learners are expected to have at least one synchronous video call / pair programming session per week with their partner, a member of their team, and/or their mentor.
-   Be prepared to make revisions to code before a successful commit. The bar for quality of contributions may be high.
-   The number of issues that you will be able to work on may vary. In fact, at times there may be more demand for issues than available issues to work on. In this case, be prepared to find other ways to contribute to Athens or other open source Clojure projects.
-   When choosing an issue:
    1. Communicate about the issue
    2. Create a branch and a WIP pull request
    3. Ask for feedback

## Join ClojureFam as a Learner

Create a card on the [Looking for Study Group/Partner board](https://github.com/athensresearch/ClojureFam/projects/3). If you do not find anyone within a few days, please say something in the learning channel in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7ztV74d).

## Getting Started

Once you have your cohort, and after introducing yourself to your team, please read the [Onboarding](./onboarding.md) document which will kickstart your journey and answer all the questions you may have.

# Why to Contribute as a Mentor

The Clojure community is friendly and welcoming like no other. Ask a question on Clojureverse, and you're bound to get a decent reply. Find the right channel on Slack, and you might just get bespoke support from the library author him or herself.

So why take part in the ClojureFam program?

Questions come and go. Libraries and side-projects get abandoned. The flux of people can make us lose track of the individuals.

As a ClojureFam mentor, you have the chance to connect personally to motivated programmers, who are learning Clojure primarily to contribute to Athens.

Athens Research is building "networked thought" tools with Clojurescript and Datascript. The people using these new "networked thought" platforms and technologies are not random people. They are hungry learners and autodidacts who want to create and share knowledge. Many have non-trivial programming experience and work at top-tier startups and corporations. They simply haven't used Clojure before. This is all to say that ClojureFam could be a great recruiting pipeline for your company :)

## Expectations for Mentors

-   Spend at least 5 weeks with your Learner team.
-   Have at least one synchronous communication session per week with your Learner team.
-   Make sure the Learners have focused goals. A Learner that "just wants to contribute to Athens" may need help in finding more specific ways to contribute.
-   To do this effectively, you may need to spend some time familiarizing yourself with the Athens project and code base.
-   Questions are almost always better than directions. Socrates showed us the way.

## Mentor in ClojureFam

Currently, the best way to announce your intention to be a Mentor in our program is to ping @nthd3gr33 in the learning channel of our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/7ztV74d). If you would prefer a different way to enter our program, feel free to email the Core Team at <researchathens@gmail.com>.
